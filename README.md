# Finance Project 3
A Finace Budgeting app

## *__Project Definition and Value__*

### Our team aims to create a web application for budgeting, tracking/forecasting spending, and money management for personal use. The user will be able to input spending through app or upload a picture of a receipt displaying spending. We want to create data visuals as well -- for this, uber's visualization library will be used. 

1. Upload data csv into app to log spending; otherwise use pictures of receipt to log data. 
2. This data will be categorized based on purchases, purchase habits, different locations and so on. 
2. Provide data visuals for both spending over a certain period and data visuals. 
3. Facilitate data by forecasting how their spending will potentially look in a given period in the future.
