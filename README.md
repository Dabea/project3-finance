# iFinace
Personal spening insignts at the item level.

iFinance enables users to track day-to-day spending at an item rather than merchant level.  We unlock the value of this data so that users can model their furure spending based on historic trends, can gain insight into the best places for them to shop, and identify the specific items they should stop purchasing in order to meet savings goals.  This tool augments other budgeting apps by providing the final level of detain and specificity necessary for users to truly manage their spening.
